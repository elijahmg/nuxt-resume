`"Only time between defeat and a new start matters"`

Hey, my name is Ilya Fakhrutdinov. I grew up in Kazakhstan, but in 2015 I've decided to change my life.
And in 2016, I took all my savings, bought a one-way flight ticket to Prague.
In February, 2016, I've started to learn Czech language with one goal on my mind, spend only five months
to learn new language.
      
It was a big challenge. But I did it.
      
Next couple of months after language school, I spent deciding my next step.
My first degree in networks field, so I decided to enhance my knowledge, but from a different side,
from a software side. I choose to get a degree in applied informatics,
in College of Polytechnics in Jihlava, Czech Republic.
My thesis was a creation mobile application for hearing test for Android platform, and again it was a challenge
for me,
because I programmed it in new language for me, Kotlin.
      
I graduated in 2019
      
During my study, I found my first job as a Web Developer and it become my passion.
I really like to be involved in interesting projects, where I can use and learn new technologies.
I'm a team player, passion about my work. Always learning.

Besides of developing, I like to read, play on the guitar and run.
